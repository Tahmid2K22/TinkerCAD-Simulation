**GitHub Repository Description:**

**Crossroad Traffic Light Control using Arduino**

This repository contains the code and documentation for a simple crossroad traffic light control system implemented using Arduino. The project simulates a basic four-way intersection traffic light system, managing the flow of vehicles efficiently.

**Features:**
- **Four-Way Traffic Control:** Manages traffic lights for North, South, East, and West directions.
- **Customizable Timing:** Easily adjustable timing for green, yellow, and red lights to suit different traffic conditions.
- **LED Indicators:** Uses LEDs to represent traffic lights for each direction.

**Components Used:**
- Arduino Uno
- LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- Resistors
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

**How It Works:**
1. The system cycles through the traffic light phases for each direction, allowing vehicles to pass safely.
2. Each direction gets a green light for a set duration, followed by a yellow light as a warning, and then a red light to stop traffic while the other directions proceed.

**Repository Contents:**
- **/src:** Contains the Arduino sketch (`traffic_light_control.ino`).
- **/docs:** Includes a detailed project report, circuit diagram, and component list.
- **/images:** Photos of the setup and working model.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Arduino sketch in the Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
5. Power up the system and observe the traffic light simulation.
